Lemon Cheesecake:

10 digestive biscuits
75g/3oz butter, melted
1 tbsp clear honey
700g/1½ lb mascarpone cheese
2 lemon, juice and zest
200g/7oz caster sugar, plus more to taste
4 tbsp icing sugar

Method
To make the base, crush 110g digestive biscuits in a food bag with a rolling pin or in the food processor.

Melt 50g butter in a saucepan, take off heat and stir in 25g light soft brown sugar and the biscuit crumbs.

Line the base of a 20cm loose bottomed cake tin with baking parchment. Press the biscuit into the bottom of the tin and chill in the fridge while making the topping.

Beat together 350g mascarpone cheese, 75g caster sugar, the zest of 1 lemon and juice of 2-3 lemons, until smooth and creamy.

Spread over the base and chill for a couple of hours.
